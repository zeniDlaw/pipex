The life cycle of a butterfly consists of four stages.
Stage one is the egg, which is laid by the adult female butterfly.
The eggs are usually laid on the leaves of plants.
Stage two is the larva, commonly known as a caterpillar.
The caterpillar hatches from the egg and begins to eat leaves.
During this stage, the caterpillar grows rapidly and molts several times.
Stage three is the pupa, also known as the chrysalis.
The caterpillar forms a protective casing around itself.
Inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar undergoes transformation.
Stage four is the adult butterfly.
The adult butterfly emerges from the chrysalis.
The butterfly dries its wings and begins to fly.
The adult butterfly will find a mate and the cycle starts again.
Butterflies play a crucial role in pollination.
They are also an important part of the food chain.
